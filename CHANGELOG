# CHANGELOG

This is rather free-form for now, but eventually this will be properly timestamped, and will mention the version the changes apply to!

2022-08-30 Fred Mercy <fred@folkloreinc.ca>

    * Changed recent hooks to consolidate into new hooks:
        - `useDragProgress` allows for getting a drag event and binding a function on it
        - it uses `useSpringValue` to tween any numeric value
        - it allows for animating styles on state changes
    * Reimplemented menus, horoscope screen (UrbaniaHoroscope) and screen transitions to leverage the new hooks

2022-08-27 Fred Mercy <fred@folkloreinc.ca>

    * Added a new hook `useProgressTransition` which leverages the `useTransitionStyles` and `useSpring` hooks, and allows for tweening styles that follow the value of a state variable
    * Added a new hook `useVerticalDrag`
    * Changed the way the main navigation menu is triggered and animated to leverage these new hooks
    * Added gestures for share menu (MenuShare.jsx) as well as for the screens menu (MenuPreview.jsx)
    * Fixed issue with mute button not appearing on an `Audio` type screen
